5 Tips for Career Growth and Development
Dr. Tracey Wilen-Daugenti, global speaker and corporate strategist on workforce development and leadership topics, and FINRA Arbitrator. recommends five additional career management strategies.

Set goals and create a plan to achieve them.
Could your career development and management use help to gain momentum? People who are the most successful and satisfied in their careers have proactively determined what they want from work.

Develop a timeline, including milestones.
Bringing your boss and their sponsorship and mentoring into the picture will ensure that you have an internal mentor who will help you manage your career.

Utilize company programs.
Some companies have formal programs to help employees develop their careers. In others, you will need to informally pursue your career development. Companies with programs generally focus energy on helping employees develop and follow a career path.

Own your career path.
A career path can be discussed at several bi-annual meetings with your boss. Some companies demonstrate a deep commitment to their employees by assisting where possible with resources of time and dollars. However, remember that it is your career path.

Write it down.
Career paths are recommended for the same reason that goals are recommended. They are the written plan that can help each employee take charge of what is most important to his or her fulfillment and success. Without a plan, you can feel rudderless and you have no benchmark against which you can measure your progress.
