## How to treat your career like a project

Lifelong projects never ends.  DIY around you home, gardening, raising kids, health & fitness...
Your career must be considered that way
To remain relevant, employable and productive you need continuous learning, if not, your skills will drop
The market moves, our employer’s business changes, the economy tanks, we’re outperformed by kids out of school,
As a Forest is just a group of trees Project is just a group of tasks that relates to each other. A project gets done by completing tasks, one task at a time, over and over again. That’s how things get done.
Managing tasks is what leads you to where we want to get to. Trying to manage projects will drive you nuts – they don’t exist.
Where a percentage of the work is beyond your current abilities, but not something completely overwhelming.
Splitting project time into 3 areas
Area1 - Learning and upskilling
Consist as acquiring information and tasks. We don’t want you to be a walking encyclopedia – we want you to be effective at work. Information alone can't make us effective and productive must acquire knowledge by putting information in actions you will know what works for you, what does not.
Make sure to align what you are learning to you strategy to put in practice what you've learned reading programming books or watching tutorials of programming doesn't make you a programmer.
Area 2 – Relationships
Building relationships is how you open doors, and relation are built one at the time through effective communication.
The world of work is all about relationships. Building strong relationships with key influencers inside your work environment, leaders and managers is a great way to show them what you can do. You can help them solve problems and of course, then use your growing relationship to get better opportunities Try to avoid any situation where you’re taking on a job you really cannot do instead take the roles that pushes you to your limits
Ensure your task lists covers these three aspects in whatever percentage makes sense for you right now. Relationships is never one way. Don’t take take take. Give more than you take. Help people and expect nothing in return. Add value to people. Be kind, caring and supportive. Treat people like people. Be friendly. Don’t let people take advantage of you. Build your communication skills. In other words, build a positive and supportive relationship. With these good relationships and a strong network, you’ll have more chance of landing a new gig, finding a promotion and ultimately, working with people you like.
Area 3 - Applying for Jobs.
Ensuring you have your CV ready, you are finding good jobs and you are understanding the recruitment process for your industry. Apply for anything that comes close to fitting your standards, even if it’s just for the interview experience. The more you work with recruiters, send applications, write cover letters, apply for jobs and perform interviews, the better you will get. You will learn more about the process, you will gather feedback about yourself, and of course, you may also land a good job.
Take time each week, or month, to stop and reflect. Are you seeing much success? Are you falling at the same hurdle each time?
This time to reflect could be spent looking at ways to get better, or finding different ways to enhance your career.
It could be that you get overlooked for promotion. Why? What do you need to improve upon?
It could be that you’re not getting past the phone interview stage. Why?
Take time to reflect and gather feedback from employers/interviewers/recruiters. You may find most won’t give you feedback but ask anyway.
Take time to study your own activities and actions.
Could you do something better?
Could you carve out more time to work on your career?
Are you applying for the right roles?
Is your CV good enough?
Are you building the right network?
